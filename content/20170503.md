1 . An Introduction to Agile Product Design

    ˙The benefits of being AGILE : boosting speed and innvation.
    
    ˙There are four tips that speed-to-market does : 
    
        1. Faster innvation : you can realize the shift of market more quiclky.
        
        2. Lower development costs 
        
        3. Anlarge market share : If there is a product being pioneer, it meets less competitors. 
        
        4. Greater forecasting accuracy : The time between product design and release is shorter, so it is more likely to be green-light or others.                                                                   
    
對產品設計及開發而言，"變得靈活"好處非常多，優勢也非常大。舉凡上列所提及，因未能更快的釋出產品，所以對產品的改革方面也有更多的時間；也因釋出的時間早，更能有效地避開競爭對手。而在具備上述條件之下，對產品開發的額外功能(像是綠能)也就有更多被考慮的空間。
